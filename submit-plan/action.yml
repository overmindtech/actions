name: Submit Terraform plan to Overmind
description: |
  Uses the Overmind CLI to submit a terraform plan as a new Change to the Overmind API. Results will be posted as a comment on the PR.

  Use the `overmindtech/actions/install` action to install the CLI before this.

  This action requires `terraform` to be installed and on the `$PATH`, as well as the modules initialised.
