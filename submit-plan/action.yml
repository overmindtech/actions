  Uses the Overmind CLI to submit a terraform plan as a new Change to the Overmind API. Results will be posted as a comment on the PR.

  Use the `overmindtech/actions/install` action to install the CLI before this.

  This action requires one or more locations of the results of `terraform show -json $TFPLAN_FILE` passed in as `plan-json`. Due to limitations of GitHub Actions, this is a space-separated list, _not_ a YAML array.

  By default this uses the calling PR as Ticket Link for the new Change.
inputs:
  ovm-api-key:
    description: Pass in an overmind token to give access to your account on Overmind
  plan-json:
    description: The location of the terraform plan file (generated from `terraform plan -out=...` and `terraform show -json ...`; defaults to `tfplan.json`). Due to limitations of GitHub Actions, this is a space-separated list, _not_ a YAML array.
    default: tfplan.json
  plan-output:
    description: The location of the terraform plan rendered output (generated from `terraform plan | tee FILE`; defaults to `tfplan.output`).
    default: tfplan.output

    description: The log level for the job
